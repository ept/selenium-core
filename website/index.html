<p>
<b>Selenium Core</b> is a test tool for web applications. Selenium Core tests run
<b>directly in a browser</b>, just as real users do. And they run in
Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. No
other test tool covers such a wide array of platforms.

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Browser compatability testing.</span>
Test your application to see if it works correctly on different
browsers and operating systems. The same script can run on any Selenium
platform.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">System functional testing.</span>
Create regression tests to verify application functionality and user
acceptance.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Selenium
Core uses a unique mechanism which allows it to run on so many
platforms. Written in pure JavaScript/DHTML, you copy Selenium
Core tests directly into your your application webserver, allowing the tests
to run in any supported browser on the client-side. Thus, you must have write access to the machine your
web application server is running on to install Selenium Core.<br>

<div style="text-align: left; margin-right: 120px;">Selenium Core was
developed by team
of programmers and testers at
ThoughtWorks (see below). It is
open-source software and can
be downloaded and used without charge. It is currently under active
development by our team. Stay tuned for updates and further
announcements.<br>

ThoughtWorks is a leader in Agile development methods for enterprise
software development. Selenium is designed specifically for the
acceptance testing requirements of Agile teams. However, teams
using more traditional development will also find it useful.<br>

<h2>How does Selenium Core Work?</h2>
Selenium uses JavaScript and Iframes to embed a test automation
engine in your browser. This technique should work with any
JavaScript-enabled browser. Because different browsers handle
JavaScript somewhat differently, we usually have to tweak the engine to
support a wide range of browsers on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

<h2>Where did Selenium Come From?</h2>

Selenium grew out of a testing framework that was
developed to acceptance-test the functionality of <a
 href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks'</a>
web-based time &amp; expense reporting application.
<i>Javascript Functional Test Runner</i> was written by
Jason Huggins, Paul Gross and Jie Tina Wang, in 2004. 
<p class="paragraph">Jason
started demoing the test tool to various colleagues. Many were
excited about its immediate and intuitive visual feedback, as well as
its potential to grow as a reusable testing framework for other web
applications.</p>
<p>Many ThoughtWorks consultants and a growing number of <a href="members.action">friends</a> 
work on Selenium here at <a href="http://www.openqa.org">OpenQA.org</a> and there are hopes for it to become the
multi-language, multi-platform defacto standard replacement for the likes of WinRunner in the web application space.</p>
<p>ThoughtWorks is a leader in Agile development methods for enterprise
software development. Selenium was designed specifically for the
acceptance testing requirements of Agile teams. However, teams
using older 'Waterfall' style methodologies may also find it useful.</p>
